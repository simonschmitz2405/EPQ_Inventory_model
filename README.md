# EPQ_Inventory_model
An EPQ inventory model considering an imperfect production system with probabilistic demand and collaborative approach

Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose an economic production quantity (EPQ) inventory model
considering imperfect items and probabilistic demand for a two-echelon supply chain. The production process
is imperfect and the imperfect quality items are removed from the lot size. The demand rate of the inventory
system is random and follows an exponential probability density function and the demand of the retailers is
depending on the initiatives of the sales team.
Design/methodology/approach – Two approaches are examined. In the non-collaborative approach, any
member of the supply chain can be the leader and takes decisions to optimize the profits, and in the
collaborative system, all members make joint decisions about the production, supply, sales and inventory to
optimize the profits of the supply chain members. The calculus approach is applied to find the maximum
profit related to the members of the supply chain.
Findings – A numerical example is presented to illustrate the performance of the EPQ model. The results
show that collaborative approach generates greater profits to the supply chain and the market’s demand
represents the variable behavior and uncertainty that is generated in the replenishment of a supply chain.
Originality/value – The new and major contributions of this research are: the inventory model considers
demand for products is random variable which follows an exponential probability distribution function and it
also depends on the initiatives of sales teams, the imperfect production system generates defective items, 
different cycle time are considered in manufacturer and retailers and collaborative and non-collaborative
approaches are also studied.
